# Example login website
This is my third project about a login and register example website. This uses localStorage, not the servers' storage, so feel free to enter anything you can think of.
# How to use
When you first enter this website, you need to go to register.html first so you can add a user for yourself. Then, you can also add more and sign out to log in another user, so it can be used for very few reasons like telling your younger brother that your PC is occupied or something. Whatever you do.
